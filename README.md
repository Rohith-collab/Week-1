Project Title: Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard using Power BI

Brief Overview:
My project involves creating a Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard using Power BI. The steps include importing a .CSV file into Power BI, transforming the data in Power Query Editor, and creating separate tables for manufacturing, suppliers, inventory, and supply chain by duplicating and cleaning the data. After transforming and applying changes, relationships are built between tables, enabling analysis and visualization of key supply chain metrics in the dashboard.

Key Features:

Data imported from .CSV files and transformed using Power Query Editor.
Segmentation of data into relevant tables (e.g., Manufacturing, Supplier, Inventory, Supply Chain).
Creation of visualizations to track and monitor sustainability metrics like carbon footprint, supplier performance, inventory levels, and delivery efficiency.
Relationships defined between tables to ensure accurate and comprehensive analysis.
Outcome:
The dashboard will offer actionable insights to improve operational efficiency, reduce waste, and promote sustainable practices across the supply chain.
